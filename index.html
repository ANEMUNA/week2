        middle of each cake comes out
        clean. After 10 mins remove the cakes from their tins and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. Fill
        how
        you
        like. My personal favourite is a good dollop of lemon curd and some fresh cream, then dust the top with
        icing
        sugar. Will keep for 3 days

        <p>Using an electric whisk beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Crack the eggs in one
            at a
            time
            and whisk well, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Add the lemon zest, vanilla,
            flour,
            milk and a pinch of salt. Whisk until just combined then divide the mixture between the two tins</p>
        <p>Bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes
            out
